# Master thesis prototype

In my master thesis at the University of Southern Denmark, I have analyzed multiple different cross-platform frameworks to select one to make a prototype of Table reservation application in. As a result of the analysis, Flutter was deemed most suitable.

This prototype is very simple, using mainly default framework widgets. One of the focus with selection and creation of the prototype was the ability to asynchronously retrieve data and update UI afterwise.
